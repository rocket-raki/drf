Beginner Level: Foundations
Django Basics

Install Django and set up your project.
Learn about Django Models, Views, and Templates.
Understand Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Learn basic URL routing and configurations.
Introduction to DRF

What is DRF? Why use it?
Install DRF: pip install djangorestframework.
Understand DRF concepts: Serializers, Views, and Routers.
Create a basic API with DRF.
Serializers

Learn the difference between serializers.Serializer and serializers.ModelSerializer.
Define fields and validations in a serializer.
Customize serialization and deserialization logic.
Basic API Views

Work with APIView.
Create CRUD operations manually (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Understand HTTP methods and status codes.
Using DRF Routers

Understand the purpose of routers.
Use SimpleRouter and DefaultRouter to simplify routing.
Intermediate Level: Enhancing APIs
Viewsets

Work with ModelViewSet and GenericViewSet.
Customize viewsets with queryset and get_queryset.
Authentication and Permissions

Explore authentication types (Session, Token, JWT).
Add permissions like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, and custom permissions.
Advanced Serializers

Nested Serializers for complex relationships.
Work with many=True for lists of objects.
Serializer create and update methods.
HyperlinkedSerializers.
Relationships

Learn about One-to-One, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many relationships in APIs.
Use RelatedField, SlugRelatedField, and HyperlinkedRelatedField.
Filtering, Searching, and Pagination

Add filters with django-filter.
Implement search with DRFâ€™s search capabilities.
Add pagination using built-in classes (PageNumberPagination, LimitOffsetPagination).
Advanced Level: Proficiency
Customizing Views

Customize get_queryset and get_serializer_class.
Use mixins to add or remove functionality.
Throttling

Learn about request throttling.
Use AnonRateThrottle and UserRateThrottle.
Versioning

Implement API versioning strategies (Namespace, URL, AcceptHeader).
Advanced Permissions

Implement role-based access control.
Build dynamic and complex permission systems.
Signal Integration

Use Django signals (post_save, pre_delete) in your APIs.
Trigger external APIs or internal actions on specific events.
Expert Level: Scaling and Optimization
Performance Optimization

Optimize database queries with .select_related() and .prefetch_related().
Use caching mechanisms (Django Cache Framework, Redis).
Reduce API latency using DRF optimizations.
Testing APIs

Write unit tests for serializers, views, and permissions.
Use APITestCase for integration testing.
Deploying DRF

Use Gunicorn or uWSGI with Nginx for production.
Serve static files with whitenoise.
Set up environment variables for sensitive data.
API Documentation

Generate API docs using tools like:
Swagger/OpenAPI (drf-yasg, drf-spectacular).
ReDoc for beautiful documentation.
WebSockets and Real-Time APIs

Implement WebSockets using Django Channels.
Add real-time functionality (e.g., live notifications or chat).
Project Ideas to Practice
Simple Blog API
CRUD operations for users, posts, and comments.
E-Commerce API
Implement product catalogs, carts, orders, and payment integrations.
Chat Application
Build a real-time chat API using Django Channels and DRF.
Task Manager API
