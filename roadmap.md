# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to guide developers from basic to advanced levels of Django Rest Framework (DRF). DRF is a powerful toolkit that allows you to build web APIs quickly and efficiently. Follow this guide to become proficient in building APIs with Django and DRF.

## Beginner Level: Foundations

### 1. Django Basics
- **What is Django?**: Django is a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Key Concepts**: Learn about Models, Views, Templates (MVT architecture), and Django's ORM.
- **Setup Project**: Install Django and set up your first project.
  - Command: `django-admin startproject projectname`
- **Create a Simple View**: Start with simple views using Django's built-in views and templates.
- **Understanding URL Routing**: Define basic URL paths using `urls.py`.

### 2. Introduction to DRF
- **What is DRF?**: Django Rest Framework is a flexible and powerful toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **Installing DRF**: Install the DRF library:
  - Command: `pip install djangorestframework`
- **First API**: Create a simple API endpoint with DRF using `APIView` and `serializers`.
- **Understand DRF Key Concepts**: Serializers, Views, and Routers.

### 3. Serializers
- **What are Serializers?**: Serializers allow complex data types, such as querysets, to be converted to native Python datatypes (e.g., dictionaries, lists).
- **Types of Serializers**:
  - `serializers.Serializer`: Manual serializer for custom fields.
  - `serializers.ModelSerializer`: Automatically generate fields based on Django models.
- **Validation**: Add custom validation logic to serializers.

### 4. Basic API Views
- **Using `APIView`**: Create basic views for CRUD operations.
- **HTTP Methods**: Handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to manage API resources.
- **Status Codes**: Understand HTTP response codes like 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 404 (Not Found), etc.

### 5. Using DRF Routers
- **Purpose of Routers**: Automatically generate URL patterns for views.
- **Router Types**: Use `SimpleRouter` or `DefaultRouter` to simplify view routing.

## Intermediate Level: Enhancing APIs

### 6. Viewsets
- **What are Viewsets?**: Viewsets combine views and serializers into a reusable unit. 
- **ModelViewSet**: A specialized viewset for CRUD operations based on a model.
- **Customization**: Modify the `queryset` or `get_queryset` to retrieve specific data.

### 7. Authentication and Permissions
- **Types of Authentication**:
  - Session Authentication
  - Token Authentication
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Permission Classes**: Control access to your API resources.
  - Example: `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`
  - Custom Permissions: Build custom permission classes for role-based access control.

### 8. Advanced Serializers
- **Nested Serializers**: Serialize related objects (ForeignKeys, ManyToMany fields).
- **Dynamic Serializers**: Build serializers that can handle complex data relationships.
- **Custom Methods**: Implement custom `create` and `update` methods for data handling.

### 9. Relationships
- **Handling Relations in APIs**: Learn about different relationships such as One-to-One, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many.
- **Types of Related Fields**:
  - `RelatedField`
  - `SlugRelatedField`
  - `HyperlinkedRelatedField`

### 10. Filtering, Searching, and Pagination
- **Filtering**: Use `django-filter` to filter data based on query parameters.
- **Searching**: Enable search functionality on fields using `search_fields`.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to split large data into multiple pages.
  - Built-in classes: `PageNumberPagination`, `LimitOffsetPagination`

---

## Advanced Level: Proficiency

### 11. Customizing Views
- **`get_queryset` Method**: Dynamically return filtered querysets based on request parameters.
- **Custom `get_serializer_class`**: Return different serializers based on request conditions (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

### 12. Throttling
- **Request Throttling**: Prevent abuse of your API by limiting the number of requests a user can make.
  - Built-in classes: `AnonRateThrottle`, `UserRateThrottle`

### 13. Versioning
- **API Versioning**: Implement versioning strategies to handle breaking changes in your API.
  - Strategies: URL Versioning, Accept Header, or Namespace versioning.

### 14. Advanced Permissions
- **Role-based Permissions**: Build a more complex permission system, such as admin, manager, user roles.
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Customize permission checks based on user roles or attributes.

### 15. Signal Integration
- **Django Signals**: Use Django signals (`post_save`, `pre_delete`) to trigger actions after certain events occur.
- **API Triggering**: Automatically make external API calls or perform internal tasks based on these signals.

---

## Expert Level: Scaling and Optimization

### 16. Performance Optimization
- **Database Optimization**: Minimize database queries with `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()`.
- **Caching**: Implement caching to improve API response times (e.g., Redis, Django Cache Framework).
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Avoid N+1 queries and optimize complex queries.

### 17. Testing APIs
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for serializers and views to ensure they behave correctly.
  - Use `APITestCase` for testing DRF views.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components of the API work together as expected.

### 18. Deploying DRF
- **Production Setup**: Configure your application for production using servers like `Gunicorn` and `uWSGI`, served by Nginx.
- **Static Files**: Serve static files in production using `whitenoise`.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data securely by setting environment variables.

### 19. API Documentation
- **Automating Documentation**: Generate interactive API documentation using tools like:
  - **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Use libraries like `drf-yasg` or `drf-spectacular`.
  - **ReDoc**: Generate beautiful API docs for your project.
- **Custom Docs**: Add custom documentation to explain your APIâ€™s usage and endpoints.

### 20. WebSockets and Real-Time APIs
- **Django Channels**: Use Django Channels to enable WebSockets and other real-time functionalities.
- **Real-time Features**: Implement real-time notifications or messaging systems with WebSockets.

### 4. **Task Manager API**
   - Create an API for managing tasks with user authentication.
   - Allow users to create, update, and assign tasks to others.

### 5. **Social Media API**
   - Design an API for posting content, following users, and liking posts.
   - Integrate media uploads (images, videos).
   
### 6. **Video Streaming API**
   - Implement an API to stream videos to users.
   - Add support for creating playlists, video search, and comments.
